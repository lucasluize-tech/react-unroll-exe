Documentation on the App:

1 - The first thing was to create the same functionality to the API for drinks and the ability to post snacks or drinks to the db.

2 - Created The links and Routes to all Drinks.

3 - Modified FoodMenu and FoodItem to include the same functionality with drinks and drink items.

4 - useEffect will now fetch data from both snacks and drinks db.

5 - modified css on navbar for better looking navigation.

6 - Created a new component for the Form to add a new Item. the form saves the data to the database in the specific category.

7 - In the original design if can't find a item it would redirect to the item menu. But it was asked to show a message. So instead, changed the cantFind parameter to a 404 route. 

PROBLEM : Re-render useEffect when redirected to any of /snacks or /drinks.
FIXED : If I change the state of snacks or drinks before redirecting, I don't need to get from the dataBase again. It will show my latest list in state.
